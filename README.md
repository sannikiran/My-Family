Family Safety App - Project Overview

Project Title: Family Guardian - Ensuring Safety and Protection
In this project, I led the development of "Family Guardian," a comprehensive safety app designed to provide immediate assistance and support to individuals in times of accidents or danger. The app is specifically tailored to ensure the safety of families, allowing them to stay connected and protected at all times.

Problem Statement: Enhancing Personal Safety
The goal of this project was to address the growing concern for personal safety, particularly for families with members of all ages. With the increasing number of accidents and potential dangers in everyday life, there was a pressing need for a reliable app that could offer immediate aid and assistance to those in distress.

Features and Functionality:
Emergency Alert System: The app incorporates an emergency alert button that, when pressed, instantly sends distress signals to pre-selected emergency contacts, along with the user's real-time location.

Geo-Location Tracking: To ensure continuous monitoring, the app utilizes GPS technology to track the user's location, allowing family members or authorities to quickly respond in case of an emergency.

Crash Detection: Using advanced algorithms, the app can detect and respond to vehicle accidents automatically, notifying emergency contacts and emergency services promptly.

Safe Zones and Notifications: Families can define "safe zones" on the app's map, and the app sends notifications when a member enters or leaves these areas, ensuring parents' peace of mind and improved child safety.

In-App Communication: Family members can communicate with each other directly within the app, facilitating quick check-ins and immediate updates on their safety status.

Technology Stack:
Programming Languages: Kotlin (Android) and Swift (iOS) for native mobile app development.
Database: Firebase for real-time data synchronization and cloud storage.
APIs: Google Maps API for location services, crash detection libraries, and emergency contact integration.
Achievements and Impact:
Successfully led a team of developers, designers, and testers throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring timely delivery and meeting all project milestones.
